# OpenNOW

OpenNOW is a native macOS cloud gaming client for browsing, launching, streaming, and recording GeForce NOW sessions.

## Current State

The repository contains a SwiftUI app target plus service, protocol, authentication, streaming, telemetry, and shared package modules. The visible frontend lives under `OpenNOW/Views` and includes:

- OAuth sign-in and branded loading surfaces
- Catalog home with a six-image hero rotation, game rails, search, filters, and detail panels
- Persistent favorites and library rails for quick game access across restarts
- Store ownership picker and launch/session overlays
- Native WebRTC streaming with input, microphone, audio, video enhancement, and diagnostics paths
- Local gameplay recordings with saved metadata and a recordings browser
- Settings for account, connections, gameplay, server location, upscaling, system, and diagnostics
