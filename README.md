# MacForce Now

MacForce Now is a native macOS cloud gaming client for browsing, launching, streaming, and recording GeForce NOW sessions.

> **MacForce Now is an independent community project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by NVIDIA.** NVIDIA and GeForce NOW are trademarks of NVIDIA Corporation. You must use your own GeForce NOW account and comply with the [GeForce NOW Terms of Use](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/terms-of-use/).

> **This is a fork of [OpenNOW-Mac](https://github.com/OpenCloudGaming/OpenNOW-Mac) that adds support for the Steam Controller 2026 ("Triton")** — including wired, Bluetooth LE, and 2.4 GHz dongle variants, with full HID input parsing and gamepad forwarding to GeForce NOW streams.

> **Why the rename?** This fork was renamed from OpenNOW to MacForce Now so it can be installed alongside the upstream OpenNOW app on the same Mac without conflicts. The bundle identifier, URL scheme, keychain services, UserDefaults domain, and preference keys are all distinct from upstream, so both apps coexist without overwriting each other's credentials, preferences, or OAuth state.

## Installation

Download the latest signed `MacForceNow.dmg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page, open it, and drag **MacForce Now** into your Applications folder. Launch the app from Launchpad or Spotlight — on first run, right-click the app in Finder and choose **Open** if macOS blocks it as an unidentified developer.

To build from source instead, see [Building](#building).

## Current State

The repository contains a SwiftUI app target plus service, protocol, authentication, streaming, telemetry, and a root Swift package for tests. The visible frontend lives under `View` and includes:

- OAuth sign-in and branded loading surfaces
- Catalog home with a six-image hero rotation, game rails, search, filters, and detail panels
- Persistent favorites and library rails for quick game access across restarts
- Store ownership picker and launch/session overlays
- Native WebRTC streaming with input, microphone, audio, video enhancement, and diagnostics paths
- Local gameplay recordings with saved metadata and a recordings browser
- Settings for account, connections, gameplay, server location, upscaling, system, and diagnostics

## Steam Controller Support (Experimental)

MacForce Now can read Valve Steam Controllers directly over HID, bypassing Steam. The pipeline is:

1. `OPN/Stream/SteamControllerHIDMonitor.swift` matches devices by vendor ID `0x28de` and product ID (see below), opens them via IOKit HID, disables the firmware's built-in keyboard/mouse emulation ("lizard mode") with periodic heartbeats, and streams raw input reports.
2. `OPN/Stream/SteamControllerReport.swift` parses each report into a `SteamControllerInputSnapshot` (buttons, triggers, sticks, and trackpads).
3. Snapshots feed the in-app test screen (Settings → Steam Controller Test) and, during streaming, `NativeWebRTCGamepadMonitor`, which forwards a standard gamepad subset (face buttons, D-pad, bumpers, triggers, sticks, select/start) to the GeForce NOW session. Steam/QAM, back grips, and trackpads are parsed and shown in the test screen but are not forwarded to the stream.

### Supported hardware

| Product ID | Device |
|---|---|
| `0x1102` | Steam Controller (2015), wired |
| `0x1142` | Steam Controller (2015) wireless dongle |
| `0x1302` | Steam Controller (2026, "Triton"), wired |
| `0x1303` | Steam Controller (2026), Bluetooth LE |
| `0x1304` | Steam Controller (2026) 2.4 GHz dongle ("Proteus") |
| `0x1305` | Steam Controller (2026) dongle variant ("Nereid") |

### Report formats and mappings

The parser understands three report layouts, with bit/byte mappings verified against Valve's contributions to SDL's HIDAPI drivers:

- **Legacy (2015)** — `ValveInReport_t`-framed packets; buttons across three bytes, trackpads double as stick/D-pad emulation. Reference: [`SDL_hidapi_steam.c`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/hidapi/SDL_hidapi_steam.c).
- **Triton (2026)** — report IDs `0x42` (wired/dongle state), `0x45` (BLE state), and `0x47` (timestamped state; inserts a 16-bit trackpad timestamp before the pad fields, shifting them by 2 bytes). A 32-bit button mask includes the Steam button (`0x0001_0000`), Quick Access (`0x0000_0010`), four back grips, trackpad touch/click bits, and per-pad X/Y plus pressure. Reference: [`SDL_hidapi_steam_triton.c`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/hidapi/SDL_hidapi_steam_triton.c).
- **Deck state** — report ID `0x09`, the Steam Deck-style 64-bit button mask with pads at fixed offsets; used when a device speaks the deck packet format. Reference: [`SDL_hidapi_steamdeck.c`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/hidapi/SDL_hidapi_steamdeck.c).

Struct layouts for all three formats are documented in SDL's [`controller_structs.h`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/hidapi/steam/controller_structs.h). Axis values normalize to `-1...1` (`Int16` full scale), triggers and pad pressure to `0...1`. Parsing is covered by `Tests/Stream/SteamControllerReportTests.swift`.

Note: Steam grabs the physical controller exclusively while it is running — quit Steam before testing.

## Project Layout

- `Model` - persisted SwiftData models, DTOs, stream value types, Twitch realtime models, and catalog value objects
- `MacForceNowApp.swift` - macOS app entry point and application delegate
- `Resources` - bundled images, fonts, and store icon assets
- `View` - SwiftUI/AppKit views, stream host views, design primitives, and asset catalogs
- `ViewModel` - observable UI state and presentation coordination for login, catalog, controller catalog, and recordings
- `OPN` - authentication, catalog/session services, native WebRTC, telemetry, Twitch, preferences, logging, and app infrastructure
- `GFN` - protocol-specific GeForce NOW clients and wire types, including CloudMatch, GDN, Jarvis, LCARS, NesAuth, NetworkTest, NVST, Starfleet, and UDS
- `Tests` - root SwiftPM test target covering the package-exposed production logic

## Packages

The root `Package.swift` exposes a testable `MacForceNow` library target over non-app-entry production logic from `Model`, `OPN`, and `GFN`. The Xcode app target compiles all five production directories, including `View` and `ViewModel`.

## Building

Build the macOS app from the repository root:

```sh
xcodebuild build -project MacForceNow.xcodeproj -scheme MacForceNow -configuration Debug -destination platform=macOS CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root so SwiftPM uses one shared `.build` graph:

```sh
swift test --scratch-path .build/shared
```

Useful focused checks:

```sh
swift test --scratch-path .build/shared --filter WebRTCStreamRecording
```

```sh
swift test --scratch-path .build/shared --filter MacForceNowGameServicesTests
```

Avoid package-local build directories during normal development. Use the root package and shared scratch path so generated SwiftPM state stays in one place and large binary artifacts such as `sentry-cocoa` are not duplicated.

To audit generated SwiftPM disk usage:

```sh
scripts/report-spm-build-size.sh
```

To remove generated SwiftPM build caches and reclaim disk space:

```sh
scripts/clean-spm-builds.sh
```

Performance audit entry points are documented under `scripts/perf-audit/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`.
