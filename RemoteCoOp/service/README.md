# Remote Co-Op Background Service

The background service runs `RemoteCoOp/panel/control-panel.mjs`. The panel is the supervised parent process and manages `RemoteCoOp/run-servers.mjs` as a child.

## Install

Linux with systemd:

```sh
RemoteCoOp/service/install-linux.sh
```

macOS with launchd:

```sh
RemoteCoOp/service/install-macos.sh
```

The installers are non-interactive. They create the panel access group, build and install the PAM helper, install the service, and start the panel. Linux stores a generated TURN secret in `/etc/opennow/remote-coop-panel.env`; macOS lets the panel create its stable secret under `RemoteCoOp/panel/state/` on first boot.

## Uninstall

Linux:

```sh
RemoteCoOp/service/uninstall-linux.sh
```

macOS:

```sh
RemoteCoOp/service/uninstall-macos.sh
```

Uninstall is non-interactive and removes the service, PAM helper, and PAM config. It keeps generated secrets/state by default so reinstalling preserves TURN credentials and panel TLS/session material. Remove generated state with:

```sh
REMOVE_STATE=1 RemoteCoOp/service/uninstall-linux.sh
REMOVE_STATE=1 RemoteCoOp/service/uninstall-macos.sh
```

The uninstall scripts leave users and groups intact by default. Remove the installer-created groups with `REMOVE_GROUPS=1`.

## Open The Panel

```text
https://198.12.95.48:8787/
```

The panel uses a generated self-signed HTTPS certificate unless `OPENNOW_REMOTE_COOP_PANEL_CERT` and `OPENNOW_REMOTE_COOP_PANEL_KEY` are configured. Browsers will warn on first access to a self-signed certificate.

## Login

Use a system username and password. Access is allowed for members of `opennow-coop-admin`. If that group does not exist, the panel falls back to local administrator groups.

The installers create `opennow-coop-admin` and add the user running `sudo` to it when possible.

## Controls

The authenticated panel can:

- Start, stop, and restart the Remote Co-Op broker/TURN child process.
- Show child status, broker endpoint, and recent logs.
- Fetch and apply Git updates with fast-forward-only pulls.

## Git Updates

Updates are intentionally conservative:

- Dirty worktrees are refused.
- Branches without upstreams are refused.
- Pulls use `git pull --ff-only`.
- Validation defaults to `node RemoteCoOp/run-servers.mjs --dry-run`.
- If panel files changed, the panel exits after update so systemd or launchd restarts it.

Automatic update checks are enabled by default every 300 seconds. Override with:

```sh
OPENNOW_REMOTE_COOP_PANEL_UPDATE_AUTOMATIC=0
```

## Linux Service Commands

```sh
sudo systemctl status opennow-remote-coop-panel
sudo journalctl -u opennow-remote-coop-panel -f
sudo systemctl restart opennow-remote-coop-panel
```

## macOS Service Commands

```sh
sudo launchctl print system/com.opennow.remote-coop.panel
tail -f /var/log/opennow-remote-coop-panel.log
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.opennow.remote-coop.panel
```
